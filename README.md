# This is a Front End test for a Junior React/ Gatsby Developer

The aim of this test is to ensure that you can style react/gatsby pages using scss modules

## The project
- You need to build the POSTS template/page, see visual here : https://www.figma.com/file/dkR892Zpog7LMBq0Ho2Lgq/Wireframing-Copy?node-id=0%3A1
- Build it using the Mobile first approach, utilsing media queries for Tablet and Desktop
- Our clients some times only provide desktop visuals and leave the responsive to us
- You will need to make this page responsive using html/scss
- Dont worry about builing too many components
- Below is a scaffold project, where you can work on index.js

## Installation:
1. Clone the repo
2. Run ```yarn install```
3. Once all is installed, run ```yarn dev``` and open http://localhost:8000 where you should see the build
3. Go to the ```src/pages``` folder and edit index.js and index.module.scss
4. Build the required page using the mobile first approach, then add media queries for tablet(if required) and desktop
5. Once you are done : ```git add. && git commit -m"Completed Code test by [Your name here]" && git push origin master```
